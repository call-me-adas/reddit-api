Development task:
Using Reddit API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api), design and implement modern frontend application for browsing articles from particular subreddits. 

Resulting application should be available and fully functional on both desktops and mobile devices. Look-and-feel will have a significant impact on the rating.

There is no need to implement authentication, a login mechanism nor users management capabilities. Simply use read-only features provided by API.

Core requirements:
  1. Switching between subreddits of your choice - i.e. Awww, memes, quantum, Music, BeAmazed.
    - The list of subreddits should be hardcoded in the app.
  2. List of the articles from chosen subreddit.
    - List should be always sorted from newest to oldest articles
    - Expanding with infinite-scroll mechanism.
    - Searching by keyword feature.
  3. Single article page with user comments.
    - Tree structure of comments should be noticeable

The type and amount of article data displayed on lists and single pages are unrestricted. It’s up to you and your sense of UX/UI.

Remember to provide tests. We don't require e2e tests (eg. selenium), but unit tests (components, utilities, reducers etc.) are a must!

Please keep in mind future development and project maintenance.

API hints:
  1. Useful endpoints for this task are:
    - https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_new
    - https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_search
    - https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_comments_{article}
  2. To receive JSON data format add '.json' suffix
    i.e.: https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/new.json - provides newest articles from subreddit 'Music'
